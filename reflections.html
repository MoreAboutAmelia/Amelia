"The following letter of recommendation is my personal opinion and it does not reflect the views of The Boeing Company in anyway. </p><br>
</UL>
 <p>
I am currently a Senior Manager in Engineering at The Boeing Company. I have been in management for nearly 20 years. I am currently responsible for Boeing Commercial Airplanes Engineering Process Management and Compliance. In this capacity, I have had the pleasure of having Amelia Steenmeyer support my organization for a total of approximately 20 months.<br>
</p></UL>
<p>Amelia has several qualities that I admire and look for in employees. She is highly organized, ambitious and works extremely well with a variety of employees.</p></UL>
<p>She has been working in a rather small group of 3-4 who have an outreach to all Engineering Functional areas such as Structures, Systems, Test and Evaluation….</p></UL>
<p>Amelia has been working in a group responsible for managing our Commercial Aircraft Engineering computing budget. She quickly learned the multiple systems which track the budget and projects and even accomplished an audit of the multi-million dollar computing maintenance expenditures. Her audit found significant engineering data discrepancies. Amelia presented her findings to a computing board which resulted in a special BCA wide cross–functional team being chartered. This team addressed these significant issues and is working to design an improved Service Level Agreement SLA oversight and management process.</p></UL>
<p>Most of her assignments have been given with little oversight and an extreme amount of schedule and quality pressure. For example, Boeing Corporate started asking for a new set of metrics for several thousand systems applications and numerous system applications projects which had various data problems. This was a monthly data call and strained our group both technically and emotionally. Amelia took the initiative to clean up the data and place it on what we called a “Metrics 1 Stop”. This initiative stopped the confusion of multiple sources of data and also improved our data quality and our image to our Directors.</p></UL>
<p>She is being asked to leave solely due to Boeing budgetary concerns and her status as a contract employee. I have attempted to hire her permanently, but have been denied this opportunity due to impending possible layoffs. I add these comments to assure you that I most definitively value Amelia’s contributions to the group and would love to find a way to keep her longer.</p></UL>
<p>If you are fortunate enough to hire Amelia, you will how quickly she fits into your organization and contributes. You will find how diligent and exacting she uses her project management expertise. You will find out how well she leverages her analytical skills and looks to improve processes."</p></UL>
